You get to work with other workaholics so that you can sleep on your dayjob, since you have now sorted your problems as a community with other awesome members of VSec.

- Feel free to open a Pull Request early so that a discussion can be had as changes are developed.

## Community project guidelines

- Projects must be related to Information Security and be relevant to either the VSec community members and/or general public.
- Projects must be open source under the MIT license.
- Projects are reviewed by the VSec community and might be discarded or archived (with notice) due to quality or being unmaintained.
