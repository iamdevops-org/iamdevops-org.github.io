Posts are stored in the [_post] directory and are written in [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), with [YML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) at the top for metadata. The `title`, `author`, and `date` properties should be set on all posts. The date should be in the filename in this formatting `year-month-day-title.md` (1999-12-31-title.md).

See this guide for further information: [GitHub - Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Guidelines to keep in mind when publishing a blog

<!-- - Posts must be related to Information Security and be relevant to either the VSec members or general public.
- Posts that include material from and/or links to commercial parties must be limited as much as possible.  
  Please consider open source alternatives.
- Posts are reviewed by the VSec Community Board and could be discarded.  
  Remember quality content is more valuable than quantity. 
- Make sure the date in the filename is today's date + name (1999-12-31-topic.md). -->

## Author profile
If you want to have you author profile information shown next to the article you should include author: name in the YML front matter.
Your profile information need to be added to '_data/authors.yml' and the picture to 'assets/images/authors/filename.jpg'
